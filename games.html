						<h2>Description</h2>
						<p>As in other multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games, each player in League of Legends controls a character with a set of unique abilities. Most games involve two teams of five players, with each player using a different champion. The two teams compete to be the first to destroy the Nexus structure within the opposing base.</p>
						<h2>Game modes</h2>
						<p>As of 2020, League of Legends offers three primary game modes: Summoner's Rift is the standard MOBA mode (and the name of its map), ARAM (All Random All Mid) offers a short but faster-paced experience, and Teamfight Tactics is an auto battler mode for eight players.</p>
						<h2>Champions</h2>
						<p>League of Legends was originally released in 2009 with 40 champions. As of November 2020, there were over 150. Older champion have been reworked with new character designs, gameplay mechanics, and lore. Champions are unlocked by in-game currency, earned by playing, or through microtransactions.</p>

						<h2>Gameplay</h2>
						<p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an action role-playing game with a third-person perspective. Players control Geralt of Rivia, a monster slayer known as a Witcher. Geralt walks, runs, rolls and dodges, and (for the first time in the series) jumps, climbs and swims. He has a variety of weapons, including bombs, a crossbow and two swords (one steel and one silver).The steel sword is used primarily to kill humans while the silver sword is more effective against creatures and monsters. Players can draw out, switch and sheathe their swords at will. There are two modes of melee attack: light attacks are fast but weak, and heavy attacks are slow but strong.Players can block and counter enemy attacks with their swords. Swords have limited endurance and require regular repair. In addition to physical attacks, Geralt has five magical signs at his disposal: Aard, Axii, Igni, Yrden and Quen.</p>
